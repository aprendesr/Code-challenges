    "    ''' This function allows to send an email to one or more destinataries. It does not require any input directly, but it is necessary to edit the information in the function code below (required fields are followed by #). The fields that need to be edited are: sender_email in the form of a string, receiver_email as a list of emails, the subject and the message body of the email to be sent. Additionally, it is required to enter the password of the sender email. In order to prevent this password from being written down inside the function, it is obtained via an input box, which provides more privacy. \n",
    "    This function can be also useful when called inside a conditional statement, for instance when an email is suppossed to be sent at a certain date and time (for birthdays), or for massive mailing for marketing purpuses.\n",
